📊 Dashboard Capabilities
1. AQI Category Distribution

Breakdown of Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, and Hazardous air quality levels across all observations.

2. Pollutant Trend Over Time

Multi-year analysis of PM2.5, NO₂, and O₃ with trendlines to identify improving or worsening pollution.

3. Seasonal Variation

Compare pollutant behavior across Summer, Winter, Spring, and Autumn.

4. Geographic Hotspot Analysis

Ranking of districts by average pollutant concentration.

5. Pollutant Correlation Heatmap

Statistical relationships between PM2.5, NO₂, and O₃ to identify shared sources or inverse behavior.

✨ Key Insights

NO₂ shows a consistent decline over several years, indicating improved emission control.
Ozone levels rise sharply in Summer, while PM2.5 and NO₂ peak in Winter.
Certain districts consistently appear as pollution hotspots.
AQI distribution suggests generally acceptable air quality, but periodic Unhealthy spikes persist.
PM2.5 and NO₂ show positive correlation; O₃ shows partial negative correlation with NO₂.

These insights highlight the value of environmental data analytics in supporting public health, regulation, and policy design.
